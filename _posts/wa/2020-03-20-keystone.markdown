The weather, tides, and timing were finally perfect for us to go to the Keystone Jetty! So we drove up and did a pair of dives. The first dive we went down through the kelp bed and along the rock jetty. Viz wasn’t amazing - only 10’ or so, and it was COLD the first dive at 43F, but the site was amazing enough to be worth it. Bzillions of white plumose anemones everywhere, plus schooling perch and kelp greenlings. We looked for the resident octopus but didn’t find it that time. When we got to the end of the jetty, the current started to turn us around so we came back up and drifted along the line at around 40’ for a while to see if we’d reach the pilings. We didn’t and eventually turned and came in. Dive two we found the octopus on the jetty! Then headed along the line to get to the pilings. The current switched so we were working to get there this time. We found a juvenile wolf eel on the way! Plus tons of hermit crabs! The pilings were really cool, covered in more plumose anemones, sea urchins, and giant barnacles. By then the current was really starting to shove us around so we let it push us back to the entry. Awesome dive day!
