We went out with Max’s buddy Connor to do a night dive at the Edmonds Underwater Park. The plan was for Max to lead us out to the Pontoon at the far west side of the park, and when it got dark out, I’d take us on a tour back in. Viz was around 15’, it was a bit currenty, and 45F in the water. We zig zagged up the trails, lots of giant lingcods and rockfish, looked at the wreck of the Triumph, then around to the Pontoon (a huge concrete structure). We came back by a feature called the Cathedrals and were swarmed by thousands of tube snouts! When we finished our dive, it was raining, which looks amazing from underwater. Overall, excellent dive!
