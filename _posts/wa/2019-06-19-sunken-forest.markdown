We went looking for the sunken forest in Lake Washington to the southeast of Mercer Island. After a hilariously terrible hike to get there, we got in the water and dropped down right on top of a massive tree stump. Viz was genuinely terrible until we got down under 40’ or so and then it opened up to a solid 20’, with the water at depth 47F (Lake Washington has sharp thermoclines as you descend). We swam around looking at all the giant tree stumps and knocked over trees. I picked up a small army of golf balls, and there’s a bunch of fishing line to watch out for. It was a very surreal dive. We came in, I swapped out my tanks (Max was on doubles), and we went back out in the other direction to see how far it went north. In the end, we couldn’t tell if we were too far out and in the shipping channel, so we did a free ascent, sent up a sausage, and then surface swam back in (we were fine, but better safe than sorry). Super interesting site! I’d definitely do it again, even with the hike.
