We went out for boat dives with Bandito charters for my birthday - Max’s first boat dive! For the first dive they took us out to Sunrise Beach Park in Gig Harbor. We dropped down and viz was pretty good, around 25’ and the water was a respectable 51F to match the 55F air temp. TONS of wolf eels of all sizes (one came out to play with me!), a number of octopuses, including a massive one. Lots of sea urchins, clams, and our standard array of fishes and sea stars. We swam down to one end of the reef, turned around, swam to the other end, then came back to the middle to do our safety stop and get picked up. Super great dive! Our second dive was at Dalco Wall to admire the geology - also excellent :D Great day!
