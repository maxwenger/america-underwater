We trekked down to the northern Oregon coast to try out brackish water diving for the first time in the Columbia River (and our first Oregon dive!). The location was a beautiful memorial park - Hammond Boat Basin - and while we were setting up I saw a porpoise in the water! We timed our trip for the best possible tides since the area can be very currenty, and when we did our dive it was thankfully current free! Entered in a small cove and grappled over some rocks in a shallow breakwater, before we swam to a row of pilings and dropped. Viz was pretty terrible from particulates in the water, somewhere between 6”-1.5’, but the water was warmer than we’ve been used to lately at 46F. Swam around a little bit, found some crabs and tiny fishes in the gloom, surfaced briefly to reorient, then dropped back down by the north jetty. Carefully followed the jetty in and found tiny versions of things we have at home - tiny crabs, a tiny gunnel, tiny jellies, tiny fish, tons of clams. It was an interesting dive, and then when we ran out of jetty we called it and headed in.
